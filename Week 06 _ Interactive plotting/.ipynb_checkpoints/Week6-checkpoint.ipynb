    "\n",
    "3. We aim to give you a gentle start with Bokeh and I am going to include more example code than usual in the follwing.\n",
    "   * **HINT 1**: If you're not an experienced Python user, I recommend going to the [official user's guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html#userguide) and working through it. Start by clicking \"Introduction\" in the linked page. That page has a glossary, a section on output methods, stuff on settings, and interfaces that you can scroll through. The next page *Basic Plotting* where the action is. Spend some time working through that.\n",

In order to fix this look into [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26254619/position-of-the-legend-in-a-bokeh-plot) as a start. Below are some code snippets that you can use to deal with this problem (but read the guide first):\n",

    "  > p.add_layout(...., ...) ## figure where to add it\n",
    "  > ### if you read the guide, it will make sense\n",
